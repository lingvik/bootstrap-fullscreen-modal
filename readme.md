# Full Screen Modal Dialogs for Bootstrap

The only difference from the forked project is that the modal-body element has the `overflow` CSS property set to `hidden`. **The body is not scrollable.**

For more information see the [forked project](https://github.com/benallfree/bootstrap-fullscreen-modal).
